TAKEWAKE Reloaded is a free operating system in C and ASM.
It is distributed under the GNU General Public License 3.
It contains a few onboard programs and is made by the TAKEWAKE Community.
Please help us to make TAKEWAKE Reloaded the best operating system in the world.
Your support would be realy helpful!

### How to start developing?
To start developing just run 'setup.sh' file in terminal on your linux computer to install all the needed utilities and then start editing.
If you're done, just run 'build.sh' in terminal to build the operating system and to test it.
If you just want to run it without rebuilding it, just run 'run-only.sh'.

### What it already have:
-Basics (Display support, ...)

-Keyboard support

-Mouse support (can be tested out in terminal with 'mouse' command)

-Sound support for built in speaker (can be tested out in terminal with 'tone' command)

-Multiple languages with different keyboard layouts (English (USA), Englisch (UK) and German (DE))

-Read date and time from CMOS (can be tested out in terminal with 'date'/'time' command)

-A few little programs (Calculator, Tic Tac Toe, ...)

-Friendly interface with arrow key navigation which is really easy to program

_...and a lot more_

### How can I help?
You can help with nearly everything.
You even don't need a lot of programing knowledge because you can write your programs in C.
You can even help us by translating programs or the OS itself into different languages.

### Do you have any questions?
Feel free to ask, we won't bite. ;)
